I would recommend any company out there to jump on board with Ted’s Gym Corporate Wellness. It is a great way to promote wellness within the workplace. On a personal note, I went through the 12-week transformation program and have lost over 120 pounds in just over a year. Ted’s Gym has truly changed my life.” – <span class="color-1">Chris Hemsworth aka Thor </span></p></div>
